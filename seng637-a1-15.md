# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The goal is to test whether the ATM functions as expected by simulating a real customer’s experience. Instead of focusing on deep testing of a few features, the plan is to briefly test all major functions to catch any obvious issues. The approach ensures that a user can successfully complete common banking tasks without errors while also checking for potential problems when pressing various buttons or taking less common actions.

### Functions Tested:
- Turning the ATM ON/OFF
- Inserting a card
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Balance Inquiry
- Transfer Funds
- Receipt collected
- Showing/hiding/clearing the log

### Approach:
- **Go step by step** – Test functions in order to not miss anything (Deposit → Withdraw → Transfer → Balance Inquiry)
- **Test a little of everything** – Try each function briefly rather than going deep into a few
- **Think like a customer** – Use the ATM as a real user would and see if things work smoothly
- **Press everything** – Try all buttons and options to check for issues

### Test Cases:
- **Common paths** – Standard transactions (ex. deposit money, withdraw from checking, check balance)
- **Edge cases** – Try things like withdrawing more than the balance or transferring with insufficient funds
- **Basic function check** – If something works once, move on to the next test
- **Usability** – See if the process is easy to follow and messages make sense

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

Team Member Role & Responsibilities

### Team Member Role & Responsibilities

- **Sadia Khan** - **Lead Tester**  
  Defining the scope of testing a product, writing test plans for the same, and guiding how tests should generally be performed.  

- **Om V. Patel** - **Test Executor**  
  Performing manual test execution, logging defects, validating test case results.  

- **Sanket Patel** - **Documentation Specialist**  
  Writing detailed reports on defects, maintaining test case documentation, accurately reporting.  

- **Ramanpreet Kaur** - **Reviewer & Validator**  
  Reviewed defect reports, reproduced issues, and retested fixes.


**Pair Testing Approach**
Collaborative Testing: Tests are being executed jointly by two team members; cross checking the findings is performed and results were validated.
Defect Logging & Tracking: Issues found are logged in Jira, and defects are assigned for resolution on the basis of severity.
Real-time Discussion: Any anomaly found was discussed then and there within the team for the further course of action.

Profound **Key Learning** from Pair Testing:-
Improved Accuracy & Efficiency: The paired testing concept helped in decreasing missed defects through the verification by a second tester.
Faster Defect Resolution: Because of real-time discussion, issues could be identified and removed faster, which increased the effectiveness of tests.
Improved Bug Tracking: Tracked all issues assigned for resolution in Jira, not even missing a bug.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

**Difficulties Encountered & Challenges Overcome**

- Unclear Requirements: Some test cases were not well defined, and expected results were not quite sure. We resolved this by having a review of industry standards and discussed with other peers.

- Inconsistent Defect prioritization: Sometimes minor UI issues were marked with high priority while serious security flaws were not even noticed. We refined the classification system to match actual impact.

- Duplicate Bug Reports: Bug reports were repeated as some amount of overlap in exploratory and manual testing was present. This really helped to a good extent-searching in Jira before logging new defects.

- Intermittent Issues: A few of the defects were not that easily reproducible, hence causing delays. Tracking test conditions and re-execution of tests in different environments helped confirm and fix these issues.

**Key Lessons Learned**

- Well-defined requirements make testing easier; well-documented requirements ensure consistency.

- Correct classification of severity contributes to efficiency: the critical ones must be dealt with first for better time management.

- Effective utilization of Jira eliminates duplicate reports: A little search before logging the defects saves efforts.

- Detail test tracking helps resolve complex issues: Capture test conditions to help debug.

- Efficiency due to familiarity with Jira: Once one gets to know ways of using Jira, one finds efficiency increasing in test management and defect tracking.

- Work is easier in collaboration: When one knows a collaboration tool, knowing the way of communication does make the work easier.
