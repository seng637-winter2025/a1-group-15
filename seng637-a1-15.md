# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

The goal is to test whether the ATM functions as expected by simulating a real customer’s experience. Instead of focusing on deep testing of a few features, the plan is to briefly test all major functions to catch any obvious issues. The approach ensures that a user can successfully complete common banking tasks without errors while also checking for potential problems when pressing various buttons or taking less common actions.

### Functions Tested:
- Turning the ATM ON/OFF
- Inserting a card
- Deposit
- Withdraw
- Balance Inquiry
- Transfer Funds
- Receipt collected
- Showing/hiding/clearing the log

### Approach:
- **Go step by step** – Test functions in order to not miss anything (Deposit → Withdraw → Transfer → Balance Inquiry)
- **Test a little of everything** – Try each function briefly rather than going deep into a few
- **Think like a customer** – Use the ATM as a real user would and see if things work smoothly
- **Press everything** – Try all buttons and options to check for issues

### Test Cases:
- **Common paths** – Standard transactions (ex. deposit money, withdraw from checking, check balance)
- **Edge cases** – Try things like withdrawing more than the balance or transferring with insufficient funds
- **Basic function check** – If something works once, move on to the next test
- **Usability** – See if the process is easy to follow and messages make sense
